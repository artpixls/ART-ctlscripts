# README #

This repository contains a list of [custom CTL scritps](https://bitbucket.org/agriggio/art/wiki/Luts#ctl-scripts) plugins for the [ART](https://bitbucket.org/agriggio/art) raw processor.

### Installation in ART ###

Each script can be loaded as a LUT in ART. In order to make it available automatically, it can simply be copied to the `ctlscripts` directory in the ART config folder (e.g. on Linux that would be `$HOME/.config/ART/ctlscripts`).
Note that many of the scripts depend also on the `_artlib.ctl` auxiliary library, so make sure to copy also that when installing.
